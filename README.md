# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Description
This project implements **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to secure a backend system. It allows users to register, log in, and access resources based on roles such as Admin, Moderator, and User. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, it ensures robust security and scalability.

## Features
- Secure user authentication with password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT-based session management.
- Role-based authorization to control access to specific resources.
- Middleware to validate user roles and permissions.
- Modular and scalable architecture.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- bcryptjs (for password hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (for JWT-based authentication)
- dotenv (for environment variable management)
